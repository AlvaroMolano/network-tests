# network-tests
Collection of python scripts to do network tests like download/upload speeds, network latency (ping) and store results in a CSV file with some stats.

The scripts have the following features:

## Features
- Run multiple tests in one go.
- Calculate average speeds for multiple tests.
- For bandwidth measurement in both Mbps and MB/s.
- Overall statistics with metrics like minimum, maximum and average speeds, and standard deviation.
- Save the results to a file with CSV format.
